What is a server
        A server is a critical component in the infrastructure of a network, providing services, data, and resources to client devices, enabling the smooth operation of web applications, databases, and various other online services.
What is the role of the domain name
        It allows users to access the website without needing to remember the numeric IP address.
What type of DNS record www is in www.foobar.com
        The www record is a CNAME (Canonical Name) or an A record pointing to the IP address 8.8.8.8.
What is the role of the web server
        This record maps the subdomain www to the server's IP address.
What is the role of the application server
        The application server runs the application code.
What is the role of the database
        It manages data storage, indexing, querying, and transaction processing.
What is the server using to communicate with the computer of the user requesting the website
        The server communicates with the user's computer over the internet using the HTTP/HTTPS protocol.
Single Point of Failure (SPOF)
        The entire system relies on one server. If the server fails, the website becomes unavailable.
Downtime During Maintenance
        Deploying new code or restarting the web server (Nginx) requires downtime, making the website temporarily unavailable to users.
Scalability
        The single server setup cannot handle a significant increase in traffic.
